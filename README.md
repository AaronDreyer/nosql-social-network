  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This is a challenge to use MongoDB and Mongoose to create a backend application that operates as a social network where users can be added, friends can be made, thoughts can be shared, and reactions to those thoughts can be shown. This is showing the usage of mongodb based databases compared to that ot SQL and sequelize.

  THis was a challenge for the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp to show my knowledge of MongoDB and Mongoose.

  Someone can use this application to see the basic back end structure of a social network app as well as how to utilize MongoDB and Mongoose to create similar applications.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  In order to install this application you most add the code to your local device by SSH or HTTPS from my repository. Then you must open an integrated terminal from this folder and npm install all dependencies. Once thats done you must activate the server through node and add this database to your Mongo Compass by added the connection based from the connection file.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  In order to operate this application, you must complete installation and then use Mongo Compass or Insomnia to operate the routes by GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE methods. This will allow control of the data within your designated database.
